# DSToolkit

DSToolkit package stands for <b>Data Science Toolkit</b> and contains methods a Data Scientist should know :tada: ! <br>
These methods are initially:

  * Sorting (bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort)
  * Searching (binary, linear, jump, inerpolation)
  * Machine Learning (linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, k nearest neighbors)

Everysingle method <b>must be</b> implemented from scratch in Python (this is where the funny part comes into play :fire: ) <br>
This package has no aim in being complete but it will be increased little by little like a snowball falling on a mountain becaming an avalanche :snowflake:
