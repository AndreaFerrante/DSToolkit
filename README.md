# DSToolkit

DSToolkit package stands for <b>Data Science Toolkit</b> and contains methods a Data Scientist should have on the back of the mind :tada: ! <br>
These methods are basically:

  * Sorting Class (Bubble, Insertion, Quick, Merge, Selection, Heap)
  * Searching Class (Binary, Linear, Jump, Interpolation)
  * Machine Learning Class (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-means, K nearest neighbors)

Everysingle method <b>must be</b> implemented from scratch in Python (this is where the funny part comes into play :fire:) <br>
This package has no aim in being complete but it will be increased little by little like a snowball falling on a mountain becaming an avalanche :snowflake:.
