# DSToolkit

DSToolkit Python package stands for <b>Data Science Toolkit</b> and collects methods a Data Scientist should have in mind. <br>

These methods are:

  * <b>Sorting</b> Class (Bubble, Insertion, Quick, Merge, Selection, Heap)
  * <b>Searching</b> Class (Binary, Linear, Jump, Interpolation)
  * <b>Machine Learning</b> Class (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-means, KNN)
  * <b>Statistical</b> Class (Rejection and MonteCarlo Sampling, Statistical Distributions)
  * <b>Utilities</b> Class (Fibonacci Serie, Palindrome String) <br>

>Every single method <b>must be</b> implemented from scratch in Python (this is where the funny part comes into play :fire:) <br>This package is not aimed to be complete and it will be growing over time.
